HOW TO RUN THE TESTER ?

Put your code with the name "the4.py" into the same folder you downloaded from here.
Open your terminal and go to the same directory.
Write python or python3.

Then run:

>>> import tester
>>> tester.tester()

It should give the result :) 

Feel free to add new cases.
generator.py is a case generator but after it adds a case, case should be modified to make sense. Keep in mind when using.

If you think something is wrong, feel free to contact me.
